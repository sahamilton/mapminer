     | Queued emails

     | a large amount of emails and process them over a long period of time,
     | the 'test' email will not be sent for a while, and that makes it difficult
     | to know if the emails are actually working or not.
     |
     | Because Eyewitness.io is already monitoring your queues seperately - there
     | is often no need for the test email to go via the queue, so it is set
     | to false by default.
     |
     | But depending on your application and specific circumstances - you might
     | want to force the email to still go via the queue - so we provide that
     | option.
